# JavaScript - The Language of the Web

## Introduction

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It's primarily known as the scripting language for Web pages but is also used in many non-browser environments.

## History

JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. Despite its name, JavaScript has no direct relation to Java. The name was chosen for marketing reasons during the time when Java was gaining popularity.

## Core Features

### Variables and Data Types

JavaScript has several data types:

```javascript
// Primitive types
let string = "Hello, World!";
let number = 42;
let boolean = true;
let nullValue = null;
let undefinedValue = undefined;
let symbol = Symbol('description');
let bigInt = 9007199254740991n;

// Object types
let object = { key: 'value' };
let array = [1, 2, 3];
let date = new Date();
let regExp = /pattern/;
let map = new Map();
let set = new Set();
```

### Functions

Functions are first-class citizens in JavaScript:

```javascript
// Function declaration
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

// Function expression
const sayGoodbye = function(name) {
  return `Goodbye, ${name}!`;
};

// Arrow function
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

### Object-Oriented Programming

JavaScript is prototype-based:

```javascript
// ES6 Class syntax
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
  
  sayHello() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}`;
  }
}

// Using the class
const person = new Person('Alice', 30);
console.log(person.sayHello()); // "Hello, my name is Alice"
```

## Modern JavaScript

Modern JavaScript (ES6+) introduced many new features:

- Arrow Functions
- Template Literals
- Destructuring
- Spread/Rest Operators
- Promises
- Async/Await
- Modules
- Classes
- Map/Set
- Symbol

## Browser APIs

JavaScript interacts with browsers through various APIs:

- DOM (Document Object Model)
- Fetch API
- Web Storage (localStorage, sessionStorage)
- Canvas API
- Web Audio API
- WebGL

## Frameworks and Libraries

Popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries include:

- React
- Angular
- Vue.js
- jQuery
- Express.js
- Node.js

## JavaScript Everywhere

JavaScript now runs in various environments:

- Browsers (client-side)
- Servers (Node.js)
- Mobile applications (React Native, Ionic)
- Desktop applications (Electron)
- IoT devices
